# Analysing-Google-play-store-reviews

**Graduate School Project**

**Main objective:**
- Analysing reviews from the Google Play Store
  - Monitor customer feedback and detect quality issues to improve customer experience
  - Provide valuable information and managerial recommendations

NOTE: 
- The the scrapping function that collects data from the Google Play Store was provided by the instructor who assigned this project. I will indicate this in the ipynb file as well.
